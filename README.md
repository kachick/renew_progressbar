# Refactoring project of http://0xcc.net/ruby-progressbar/

* ***This repository is archived***
* ***No longer maintained***
* ***I didn't publish this project to https://rubygems.org as a gem***

* I was retired this refactoring and build from scratch as https://github.com/kachick/terminal-progress_bar
* Upstream is merged in https://github.com/jfelchner/ruby-progressbar now

So this repository does not have any meaning except my struggle memory.
